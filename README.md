# Software-Engineering-Resources
This is a repository meant to list online resources that I've completed and found useful, preferably in the order they should be done.

# [CS50 - Harvard](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)
This is an intro to the basics of computer science including abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. It's probably one of my favorite courses ever. 

# [Missing Semester - MIT](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
This course covers a lot of the 'missing ' knowledge that you're supposed to accrue throughout your CS learnings. Unfortunately, I feel like a lot of courses assume you've picked these things up already and don't teach them. This course remedies that. I've completed the course and I enjoyed it thoroughly!

# [Full Stack Open - University of Helsinki](https://fullstackopen.com/en)
Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. I haven't worked with most of these technologies so I am eager to learn!

# [Nand2Tetris - (Formerly Harvard CS101)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)
This is based on a [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_schocken_the_self_organizing_computer_course) about starting at the building blocks of computers (NAND gates) and building up a simulated computer. Although it assumes no previous CS knowledge, I think it would be a bit tricky without.
